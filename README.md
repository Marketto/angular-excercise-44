### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: development tools and application specific packages. They are both managed with npm in package.json as devDependencies and dependencies respectively.

```
npm install
```

### Running the App during Development

The angularjs-typescript-webpack project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver. It is a webpack-dev-server, that supports hot reload.  You can start this webserver with `npm start`.

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Building and running the App in Production

To build the application for production just run `npm build`, it creates dist directory that have the production optimized build.
